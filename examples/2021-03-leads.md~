# Assignments and Access Rules

Access rules let you control how a shared document is used, and maintain
a separation of roles and responsibilities.  For example, suppose an entrepeneur
is using Grist as an ad-hoc lead tracker for sales and potential advisors.
Then they hire some freelancers to delegate sales leads to, while keeping the
potential advisors private.  They want to be able to assign someone to follow-up
a lead, just by writing their initials in an "Assignment" column, and not
allow anyone else to change that assignment.  Here's what they might come up with:

With the rules shown here:

Here's what the rules do:

  * Restricts all access to the Advisors table to the owner.
  * Allows only the owner to update anything in the Name or Assignment column in the Leads table.
  * Forbids anyone other than the owner from deleting a row of the Leads table.
  * Forbids anyone other than the owner from modifying the document's structure.

There are also two special rules, that would typically be turned off:
  * Allow everyone to view Access Rules - normally this would be forbidden if the rules 
    might contain private information, but it is useful to allow this for examples.
  * Allow everyone to download or copy the full document - normally this would be forbidden
    if it would allow working around restrictions, but again it is useful to allow this for
    examples.
