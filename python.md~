Python
-------

Grist formulas are written in Python, the most popular language for data science.
The entirety of [Python's  standard library](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/) is available
to you. For those with a spreadsheet background, we've also added a suite of Excel-like
functions, with all-uppercase names. Here's the [full list of functions](functions.md).

## Python version

At the time of writing, on [getgrist.com](https://getgrist.com) documents use one of two
versions of Python:

 * Python 3 (specifically 3.9)
 * Python 2 (specifically 2.7)

Newly created documents use Python version 3.9


Documents created before November 8 2021 use Python version 2.7 by default.


You can change the Python version by changing the engine under [Document Settings](creating-doc.md#document-settings),
but formulas which worked in Python 2.7 may not work in 3.9 so this is not recommended for non-technical users.
Assisted upgrades are coming soon!
