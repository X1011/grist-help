# Integrations via Zapier

Grist can be connected to thousands of other services via
[Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/grist/integrations).  For example,
Grist can trigger an integration workflow whenever there is a new or
updated record in a table.  Conversely, integration workflows can
find, add, or update records in Grist tables.
