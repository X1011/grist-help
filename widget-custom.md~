# Page widget: Custom

The **Custom** widget allows an advanced user to insert almost
anything in their document.  To use it currently requires knowledge of
web development, and access to a public web server (for example,
GitHub Pages).

There is a small amount of configuration possible within Grist:

 * Choose a URL for the page to show within the widget.
   This should be a page owned and controlled by you.

 * Choose an access level for the page.
   - None: the page is shown, but has no access to the document containing it.
   - Full: the page is shown, and has full access to read and modify the document
     containing it.

The bulk of the configuration happens outside Grist, when preparing
the custom widget page.

 * getDocName
 * listTables
 * fetchTable(tableId)
 * applyUserActions(actions)
