# On-Demand Tables

A defining feature of spreadsheets is that as you make changes, ...

Tables may be marked as "on-demand" to avoid loading them into the data engine.
What does that mean?

If you make table On-Demand, its data will no longer be loaded into
the calculation engine and will not be available for use in
formulas. It will remain available for viewing and editing.  Changing
this setting will reload the document for all users.
